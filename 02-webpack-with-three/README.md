# Three.js with Webpack

## About

Starter code in this folder is provided by the Three.js journey course.

While following along the course, I customize things to maximize learning, hence the final code in this folder _might_ be different compared to the final result from the course.

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
